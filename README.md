# LucienAI (a.k.a. Noctel)

LucienAI (code name ‚ÄúNoctel‚Äù) is a mystical AI coding companion built to help developers code faster, smarter, and with a touch of wizardry.

Currently running on Groq‚Äôs free API, Lucien can:
- Respond to your coding questions
- Generate Python code
- Save generated code into files
- Execute code directly from the console

All from a lightweight terminal-based interface.

‚úÖ Communicates via Groq‚Äôs LLM (LLaMa3-70B)  
‚úÖ Detects code blocks in LLM responses  
‚úÖ Optionally saves and runs code automatically  
‚úÖ Displays CPU usage stats

## Future Goals

Lucien is only getting started. Planned magical upgrades include:

‚ú® **Voice Interaction**  
- Integrate Text-to-Speech (TTS) for Lucien‚Äôs voice
- Add ‚Äúwizard voice‚Äù options for extra flair

ü™Ñ **Magical GUI**  
- Design a GUI inspired by mystical, arcane aesthetics (think anime spell effects or Doctor Strange vibes!)
- Use generative art tools for custom visuals
- Dark mode by default, obviously

üéõ **Automation & Productivity**  
- Automate workflows in Ableton Live and other music production tools
- Build project-specific coding workflows
- Context-aware assistance (detect what project or app you‚Äôre working on)

ü§ñ **Self-Improvement**  
- Allow Lucien to write or modify its own codebase (under controlled conditions!)
- Train custom prompts for more advanced, personalized assistance
